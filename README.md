# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster Prediction
Analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. I apply the tools of machine learning to predict 
which passengers survived the Titanic tragedy.

Implementing Method :
- Collecting the data
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering
- Modelling
- Testing
# My Accuracy is 82.9% in local server and 78.65% (in Top 33% submission at Kaggle).

Used Tools:
- Kaggle Data sets
- Jupyter NoteBook
- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit learn
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
